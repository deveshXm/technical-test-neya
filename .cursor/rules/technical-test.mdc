# nstructions for Neya’s Technical Test

## Overview

The [technical test repo](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test) contains a very small chat application and an intentionally unfinished AI agent.

The goal is **not** to build a feature-rich app, but to design a **well-behaved AI agent** that helps people find the right group.

Timebox: **~2–3 hours**.

## Getting started (template repo)

This repo is a **GitHub Template**.

### Do

- Click **“Use this template”** on GitHub to create **your own repo** from this template (preferred).
    - If you can’t use templates, you can **fork** it instead.
- Clone **your** repo locally and do your work there.
- Follow [**`README.md`**](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/README.md) for how to install dependencies, add API keys, and run the app locally.

## The Context

Neya makes it easy to find and connect to people, groups and businesses in your local area. People express their local requests to Neya, either on WhatsApp, or via our App. These requests can be very specific "I want to borrow a drill on Saturday" or very vague "I'd love to know more parents in my area". Neya needs to be able to understand the user intent, clarify with warmth, choose the right type of connection, manage a users emotional journey and reliably deliver a valuable connection if wanted. 

This Technical Test is working on a highly simplified version of Neya, designed to help stimulate a great conversation around the choices and trade-offs we have in designing this system. We are focused on groups only, but all the same considerations about reliability, trust and emotional warmth apply. 

Enjoy! 

## The scenario

For this exercise, a user should be able to send a simple message to Neya, for example:

> “I’d love to join a group with other parents with toddlers.”
> 

Your agent should:

- Understand the request
- Decide whether to ask **one** clarifying question, or search for a matching group
- Respond in a warm, human way (including a suggestion when possible)

## The tasks

### Task 1: Add conversation history (multi-turn)

Right now the app sends **only the latest user message** to `/api/chat`.

### Do

- Make sure the agent has the full conversation history in context.

Suggested touch points:

- [`components/Chat.tsx`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/components/Chat.tsx)
- [`app/api/chat/route.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/app/api/chat/route.ts)
- [`lib/agent.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/agent.ts)

### Done looks like

- After the user adds important context (e.g. “Actually I prefer weekday mornings”), the agent uses that information on the next turn.

You do **not** need a database for this. **Client-side or in-memory state** is completely fine — just explain trade-offs in [`NOTES.md`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/NOTES.md).

It’s fine if the conversation disappears when refreshing the page.

### Task 2: Clarification (ask one good question)

### Do

- Before searching, decide if you have enough info to pick a group.
- If not, ask **one** clarifying question that *changes* what you would search for.

### Done looks like

- You ask **one** clarifying question (not multiple).
- You don’t ask for unnecessary personal info.

### Examples of good clarifying questions (aligned with the dataset)

- “Is this for parents with toddlers, new mums, or meeting people generally?”
- “Would you prefer something like a weekday morning walk, or an evening meetup?”
- “Are you hoping for something active (a run / cycle), or something social (coffee / board games / book club)?”
- “Are you looking for something community-focused (like volunteering), or more just to meet people?”

### Task 3: Group search + suggestion

### Do

- Implement the “group matching” logic
- You can put it wherever you like (e.g. directly in [`lib/agent.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/agent.ts), or in a new module you create under `lib/`).
- Use [`lib/mockGroups.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/mockGroups.ts) as the only source of truth (feel free to extend).
- In [`lib/agent.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/agent.ts), when the request is clear enough:
    - Call your matching/search logic
    - Pick the best match (or a small shortlist)
    - Respond with a suggestion and a short reason

### Done looks like

- The agent suggests a **real group** from [`lib/mockGroups.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/mockGroups.ts).
- It doesn’t hallucinate groups or details.
- If search returns no good match, the agent either apologises to the user, or asks another clarifying question (if more information is required)

We understand you may not have enough time to implement the perfect solution. If you run out of time, write your proposed “next steps” in [`NOTES.md`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/NOTES.md).

### Bonus task: Lightweight evaluation (tests / eval)

### Do

- Add a small way to **verify behaviour** and catch regressions.
- Keep it lightweight and pragmatic — it can be tests, a script, or even a documented eval checklist.

Examples of things to test

- Suggestions are **only** from [`lib/mockGroups.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/mockGroups.ts) (never hallucinated)
- Ambiguous inputs trigger **one** clarifying question
- Clear inputs produce a reasonable suggestion

### Done looks like

- It’s easy for us to run/check quickly.
- It exercises the **core requirements** (no hallucinated groups, one clarifying question, safe fallbacks).

## Hard requirements (please follow)

- **Do not allow hallucinated groups**. Only suggest groups that exist in [`lib/mockGroups.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/mockGroups.ts).
- **The AI should be calm and human** (no robotic “As an AI model…” tone).
- Clarifying questions should be helpful in determining the best result.

## What you don’t need to do

- Authentication
- A database (client-side / in-memory state is fine)
- Perfect matching logic
- Real maps or geo
- Complex UI

## How we’ll assess your submission

We’re not scoring “feature count”. The main thing we’re assessing is your ability to build a **reliable agentic system**: good judgement, safe behaviour, and predictable outcomes under ambiguity.

This is your chance to demonstrate what you know — if anything important isn’t obvious from the code (trade-offs, assumptions, edge cases, why you structured it a certain way), please write it down in [**`NOTES.md`**](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/NOTES.md).

- **Correctness**: suggests only real groups; doesn’t hallucinate.
- **Ambiguity handling**: asks one good clarifying question when needed; doesn’t interrogate.
- **Search quality**: can find the right group from messy user text; reasonable ranking/selection.
- **Reliability**: handles empty results and LLM weirdness safely (fallbacks, validation, guardrails).
- **Code quality**: readable TypeScript, sensible structure, clear naming, minimal complexity.
- **Communication**: helpful notes/trade-offs in [`NOTES.md`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/NOTES.md) if you run out of time.

## Libraries / frameworks

This starter uses the [**Vercel AI SDK**](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) (see [`lib/llm.ts`](https://github.com/joinneya/technical-test/blob/main/lib/llm.ts)) to keep the LLM integration tiny and provider-agnostic.

You’re welcome to use **any agent library/framework** you prefer — or **no library at all**.

Popular options include:

- [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/)
- [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)
- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs)
- [LlamaIndex](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/)
- [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-js/)
- [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)
- [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/)

## Submission

Please share:

- A GitHub repo (or zip)
- Any setup notes
- Roughly how long you spent

## Next Steps

If it looks promising, we’ll invite you to a call to walk through your agent design, trade-offs, and how you’d extend this in production. This will be your chance to explain what you did, the decisions you made, and what you’d do if you had more time.
